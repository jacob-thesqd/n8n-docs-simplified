## Finding Nodes

### Search by Service
Use the search function to find nodes for specific services:
- Type the service name (e.g., "Gmail", "Slack")
- Browse by category
- Filter by node type

### Search by Function
Look for nodes based on what you want to do:
- "send email" → Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid
- "database" → MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- "webhook" → Webhook, HTTP Request
- "schedule" → Cron, Interval

## Node Documentation

Each node includes comprehensive documentation:

### Parameters
- Required and optional settings
- Data types and formats
- Authentication requirements
- Usage examples

### Examples
- Common use cases
- Sample configurations
- Best practices
- Troubleshooting tips

## Community Nodes

Extend n8n's functionality with community-created nodes:

### Installing Community Nodes
1. Go to **Settings** → **Community Nodes**
2. Enter the npm package name
3. Click **Install**
4. Restart n8n if required

### Popular Community Nodes
- **n8n-nodes-playwright** - Browser automation
- **n8n-nodes-puppeteer** - Web scraping
- **n8n-nodes-openai** - AI and ChatGPT integration
- **n8n-nodes-redis** - Redis database operations

## Creating Custom Nodes

### When to Create Custom Nodes
- Service doesn't have an existing node
- Need specialized functionality
- Want to contribute to the community
- Require specific data transformations

### Development Process
1. **Setup** - Use n8n's node development toolkit
2. **Code** - Implement node logic and parameters
3. **Test** - Verify functionality and edge cases
4. **Package** - Create npm package
5. **Publish** - Share with the community

## Best Practices

### Node Selection
- Choose the most specific node for your use case
- Prefer official nodes over community ones for reliability
- Check node documentation for limitations
- Consider maintenance and support

### Configuration
- Use meaningful names for nodes
- Add descriptions for complex configurations
- Test nodes individually before connecting
- Keep credentials secure and organized

### Performance
- Batch operations when possible
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement error handling
- Monitor execution times
