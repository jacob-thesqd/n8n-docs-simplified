## What are Workflows?

A workflow in n8n is a collection of connected nodes that automate a specific task or process. Think of it as a flowchart where each step (node) performs a specific action, and the arrows between them show how data flows from one step to the next.

## Workflow Components

### Nodes
Nodes are the building blocks of workflows. Each node has a specific function:

- **Trigger Nodes** - Start the workflow when certain conditions are met
- **Regular Nodes** - Process, transform, or send data
- **Conditional Nodes** - Control the flow based on conditions

### Connections
Connections show how data flows between nodes. Data from one node's output becomes the input for the next node.

### Executions
An execution is a single run of a workflow. Each execution processes data through all connected nodes.

## Workflow Types

### Manual Workflows
- Started manually by clicking "Execute Workflow"
- Useful for testing and one-time tasks
- Good for data migration or analysis

### Automated Workflows
- Started by trigger nodes automatically
- Run based on schedules, webhooks, or external events
- Handle ongoing processes and integrations

## Data Flow

Data in n8n flows from node to node in JSON format. Each node:

1. **Receives** data from the previous node
2. **Processes** the data according to its function
3. **Outputs** the processed data to the next node

### Example Data Flow

```json
// Input data to HTTP Request node
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users"
}

// Output data from HTTP Request node
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "John"},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Jane"}
  ]
}

// Processed data after transformation
{
  "users": ["John", "Jane"],
  "count": 2
}
```

## Best Practices

### Planning Your Workflow

1. **Define the goal** - What should the workflow accomplish?
2. **Map the steps** - What actions need to happen?
3. **Identify triggers** - What should start the workflow?
4. **Plan error handling** - What if something goes wrong?

### Organizing Workflows

- Use descriptive names for workflows
- Add notes to complex nodes
- Group related workflows in folders
- Use consistent naming conventions

### Testing and Debugging

- Test workflows with sample data first
- Use the execution history to debug issues
- Add error handling for critical paths
- Monitor workflow performance

## Common Patterns

### Data Synchronization
```
Trigger → Get Data → Transform → Send to Destination
```

### Notification System
```
Trigger → Check Condition → Send Alert → Log Result
```

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
Trigger → Fetch Data → Validate → Transform → Store → Notify
```

<Tip>
  Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity. It's easier to debug and maintain smaller, focused workflows.
