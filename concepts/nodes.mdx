## What are Nodes?

Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of n8n workflows. Each node performs a specific function, such as retrieving data, processing information, or sending notifications. By connecting nodes together, you create powerful automation workflows.

## Node Types

### Trigger Nodes
Trigger nodes start workflow executions. They "listen" for events and begin the workflow when conditions are met.

**Examples:**
- **Manual Trigger** - Start workflow manually
- **Webhook** - Respond to HTTP requests
- **Cron** - Run on a schedule
- **File Trigger** - Watch for file changes

### Regular Nodes
Regular nodes process data and perform actions. They receive data from previous nodes and output processed results.

**Examples:**
- **HTTP Request** - Make API calls
- **Gmail** - Send and receive emails
- **Slack** - Send messages and notifications
- **Google Sheets** - Read and write spreadsheet data

### Conditional Nodes
Conditional nodes control workflow flow based on data or conditions.

**Examples:**
- **IF** - Branch based on conditions
- **Switch** - Multiple condition branches
- **Merge** - Combine data from multiple paths

## Node Structure

Every node has several key components:

### Parameters
Configuration settings that define how the node behaves.

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/data",
  "authentication": "headerAuth"
}
```

### Input Data
Data received from the previous node or trigger.

### Output Data
Data produced by the node that flows to the next node.

### Credentials
Authentication information for external services.

## Working with Nodes

### Adding Nodes
1. Click the **+** button on the canvas
2. Search for the desired node
3. Click to add it to your workflow
4. Configure the node parameters

### Configuring Nodes
1. Double-click a node to open its configuration
2. Fill in required parameters
3. Set up authentication if needed
4. Test the node configuration

### Connecting Nodes
1. Click and drag from one node's output to another node's input
2. Data flows in the direction of the arrow
3. Multiple connections create branching workflows

## Common Node Patterns

### Data Transformation
```
HTTP Request → Set → Function → Next Node
```

### Error Handling
```
Try Node → [Success Path] → Continue
         → [Error Path] → Error Handler
```

### Conditional Processing
```
IF Node → [True] → Action A
       → [False] → Action B
```

## Best Practices

### Node Configuration
- Use descriptive node names
- Add notes to complex configurations
- Test nodes individually before connecting
- Keep sensitive data in credentials

### Data Processing
- Validate input data before processing
- Handle empty or null values
- Transform data consistently
- Use appropriate data types

### Error Handling
- Add error handling for critical paths
- Log errors for debugging
- Provide fallback actions
- Monitor node performance

## Node Development

### Custom Nodes
Create custom nodes when existing ones don't meet your needs:

1. **Community Nodes** - Install from the n8n community
2. **Custom Development** - Build your own nodes
3. **Function Nodes** - Write custom JavaScript code

### Function Node Example
```javascript
// Process items from previous node
return items.map(item => {
  return {
    json: {
      processedAt: new Date(),
      originalData: item.json,
      processed: true
    }
  };
});
```

<Tip>
  Start with simple nodes like HTTP Request and Manual Trigger to understand the basics before moving to more complex integrations.
